Modlog-Windows
==============

A modlog implementation for the Windows OS.

This is for [Pok√©mon Showdown!] (https://github.com/Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown).

This is *very* loosely based upon Joim's [original] (https://github.com/Joimer/scripts/blob/master/winmodlog.js) Windows implementation.

In implementation, replace the existing modlog command with this one. Also, add a comma at the end of the command.
